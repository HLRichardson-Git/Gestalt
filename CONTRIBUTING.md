Contributing to Gestalt
============================

Gestalt began as a personal hobby of mine to have all my cryptographic
primitives in one place. So if you are interested in learning more about
cryptography and implementing it in a efficient manner you are in the right place.

Gestalt does not currently plan to be a replacement to current cryptographic
libraries (but it would be nice), so no experience is needed to contribute.
We do still try to follow best practices and standards when available, so heavy
documentation is necessary. Even though this is not intended as a production library, 
keeping in mind security risks and unsafe coding practices is necessary.

To request new a feature, ask a question, or report a bug,
please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/HLRichardson-Git/Gestalt/issues).

Getting started
============================
First is to ensure you have your GitHub account working, and ready to contribute. The next step
should be to check out the posted [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/HLRichardson-Git/Gestalt/issues).
There are many labled as **Good First Issue**, so those are a good starting point. If there are no
posted issues that you think you would be able to contribute to, feel free to open a new issue.

Also questions are highly encouraged, this is intended as a learning environment. Even as someone
who works in the field I am still learning every day.

Contacting
============================
It is planned to make a better way to get in touch with me, but for now feel free to reach out to me here.
