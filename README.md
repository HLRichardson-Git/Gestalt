Gestalt is an open-source project where contribution is encouraged, having
a local copy of the git repository with the entire project history gives you 
much more insight into the code base.

A local copy of the Git Repository can be obtained by cloning it from

    git clone https://github.com/HLRichardson-Git/Gestalt.git
